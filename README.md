# BcbDatabase
I started this project to teach myself Python/Django. It's a web app that (should) allow transcribing (Bittersweet Candy Bowl)[https://www.bittersweetcandybowl.com].
The aim of the web app is to make BCB searchable. The transcribed text should also make the comic easier to read for readers that aren't familiar with English.
